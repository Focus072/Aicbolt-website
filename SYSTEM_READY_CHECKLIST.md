## ðŸš€ n8n Live Integration Steps

Once all manual tests pass:

### **Step 1: Configure n8n Workflow**

1. Open your n8n workflow
2. Add HTTP Request node
3. Set URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/leads`
4. Set Authentication: Bearer + `{{ $env.SCRAPER_API_KEY }}`
5. Map Google Maps fields to payload
6. Save workflow

### **Step 2: Test Single Execution**

1. Trigger workflow manually with 1 place
2. Check n8n shows 201/200 success
3. Verify data appears in Leads Dashboard
4. Check all fields populated correctly

### **Step 3: Test Batch Execution**

1. Run workflow with 5-10 places
2. All should return 201 (new) or 200 (exists)
3. Check Leads Dashboard shows all entries
4. Verify no duplicates (same place_id updates)

### **Step 4: Monitor Production**

1. Set up error alerts in n8n
2. Monitor Leads Dashboard for incoming data
3. Check database size periodically
4. Review failed requests if any
